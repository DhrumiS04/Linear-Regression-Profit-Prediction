# Profit-Prediction-LR
This repository hosts a collection of custom machine learning implementations entirely built from scratch, without relying on popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or statsmodels. The primary objective of this project is to delve deep into the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms by developing them from the ground up.
