This repository contains a custom implementation of univariate linear regression. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of linear regression and gradient descent optimization. This algorithm predicts the profit when a population shares a bike in 10,000s which makes inferes how univariate linear regression works along with gradient descent.

## Load the Data and Libraries:
The initial step involves loading the dataset and necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical computation and Seaborn for data visualization.

## Visualize the Data:
Visualize the dataset to gain insights into its structure and relationships. This step involves plotting the data points using Seaborn to identify any patterns or trends.

## Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃):
Implement the cost function 𝐽(𝜃) to evaluate the performance of the linear regression model. This function measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the dataset.

## Gradient Descent:
Implement the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function 𝐽(𝜃). Gradient descent iteratively updates the model parameters (θ) to find the optimal values that minimize the cost.

## Visualize the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃):
Visualize the cost function 𝐽(𝜃) to understand its behavior and how it changes with different values of θ. This step helps in interpreting the optimization process and identifying convergence.

## Plot the Convergence:
Plot the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm by tracking the changes in the cost function over iterations. This visualization illustrates how the cost decreases over time as the algorithm progresses.

## Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit:
Fit the training data using univariate linear regression with the optimized θ values obtained from gradient descent. This step involves predicting the target variable based on the input features and the learned model parameters.

## Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values:
Utilize the optimized θ values to make predictions on new data instances. Inference allows us to estimate the target variable for unseen data points based on the learned linear regression model.
